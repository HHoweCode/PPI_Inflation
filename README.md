# 🧮 Forecasted U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI) Analysis (2003–2024)

## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of forecasted changes in the U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI) for agricultural and wholesale commodities from 2003 to 2024. It combines SQL-based data querying with interactive Tableau dashboard development to extract key insights into pricing trends, forecast volatility, and the economic impacts of pivotal events such as the 2008 financial crisis, U.S. election years (2012 & 2016), and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.

The result is a compelling, data-driven story that highlights how macroeconomic conditions shape commodity market expectations over time.
